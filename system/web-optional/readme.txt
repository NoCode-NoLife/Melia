This folder contains optional web server pages that aren't available by
default, such as a simple registration script. To enable those pages,
simply copy their folder to user/web/.

For example, if you want to make use of the registration page, copy the
folder "register" to user/web/. Afterwards you'll be able to access
it via your browser from http://***/register/ or
http://***/register/index.cs, where *** is the address of your web server.
