Optional Web Pages
=============================================================================

This folder contains optional web server pages that aren't available by
default. To enable those pages, simply copy their folder to user/web/.

For example, if you want to make use of the registration page, copy the
folder "register" to user/web/. Afterwards you'll be able to access
it via your browser from `<url>/register/` or `<url>/register/index.php`,
where `<url>` is the address of your web server, such as `http://127.0.0.1`.
