// Melia
// Database file
// 
// This database contains a list of server groups. Each group may be
// considered one "game world", each with a variable amount of barracks,
// zones, and other types of servers. Servers must have an entry in this
// list to be able to launch and their connection parameters are shared
// with the clients to inform them how they can reach any given server.
// 
// The example entries are only suitable for playing on the hosting machine.
// To enable connections over the network or internet, override this data
// (ideally from the user folder) to assign your network/public IP to the
// server IPs and ensure that the respective ports are opened.
