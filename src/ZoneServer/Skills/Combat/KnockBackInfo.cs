			// too much for now.
			// 
			// Here are some examples. The expected values were gathered
			// by having the client calculate the distance of a knocked
			// back monster based on the positions before and after the
			// knock back.
			// 
			// Velocity: 100, Expected: 8.5835532351144, Formula:  8.00
			// Velocity: 125, Expected: 13.360553023927, Formula:  12.5
			// Velocity: 150, Expected: 17.700299992446, Formula:  18.0
			// Velocity: 175, Expected: 26.186134491803, Formula:  24.5
			// Velocity: 200, Expected: 34.202182950439, Formula:  32.0
			// Velocity: 225, Expected: 41.300142972251, Formula:  40.5
			// Velocity: 250, Expected: 52.128298346989, Formula:  50.0
			// Velocity: 300, Expected: 70.325086038326, Formula:  72.0
			// Velocity: 400, Expected: 106.24073509195, Formula: 128.0
			// 
			// Update: After some more research there appears to be another
			// factor involved in the calculation. The VAngle determines
			// how far the monsters flies up into the air, which affects
			// the distance it travels. That means the formula is even
			// more wrong than I initially thought, because it will
			// basically only work on simple push backs. The VAngle

			// a velocity of 150, and since 150 / 1000 * 0.8 = 0.12, we
			// end up with this formula.
