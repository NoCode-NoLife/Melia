Scriptable Functions
=============================================================================

## Introduction

In essence, scriptable functions are C# methods like any other,
but the server gathers them and saves references to them, to
be able to later call them from anywhere. This makes it easy
to quickly call methods by name globally, which is particularly
handy for overwriting methods from scripts or to reference
methods by name, as is done for item usage scripts.

## Example

To illustrate this, take a look at the following scriptable
function, which is referenced in the item data by its name,
`SCR_USE_ITEM_EXPCARD`. When the item is used, we get the
function by name and call it with the arguments defined in
the item data.
```cs
[ScriptableFunction]
public ItemUseResult SCR_USE_ITEM_EXPCARD(Character character, Item item, string strArg, float numArg1, float numArg2)
{
	var baseExp = (long)numArg1;
	var jobExp = (long)(baseExp * 0.77f);

	character.GiveExp(baseExp, jobExp, null);
	character.PlayEffect("F_sys_expcard_normal");

	return ItemUseResult.Okay;
}
```

## Attribute

The way we accomplish this is via the `ScriptableFunction` attribute.
Every function that is part of a `GeneralScript` and is decorated with
this attribute will be considered a scriptable function, using either
the function's name or the string defined in the attribute. For example,
the following function would get registered as `SCR_USE_ITEM_EXPCARD`
as well.

```cs
[ScriptableFunction("SCR_USE_ITEM_EXPCARD")]
public ItemUseResult UseExpCard(Character character, Item item, string strArg, float numArg1, float numArg2)
```

## Types

Because of the nature of C#'s static typing, we only support
pre-defined delegate types as scriptable functions. The defined
types are as follows.

```cs
float Character(Character character);
float Monster(Mob monster);
float Skill(Skill skill);
float Combat(ICombatEntity attacker, ICombatEntity target, Skill skill, SkillModifier modifier, SkillHitResult skillHitResult);
SkillHitResult SkillHit(ICombatEntity attacker, ICombatEntity target, Skill skill, SkillModifier modifier);
ItemUseResult ItemScriptFunc(Character character, Item item, string strArg, float numArg1, float numArg2);
NormalTxResult NormalTx(Character character, string strArg);
NormalTxResult NormalTxNum(Character character, int[] numArgs);
DialogTxResult DialogTx(Character character, DialogTxArgs args);
CustomCommandResult CustomCommand(Character character, int numArg1, int numArg2, int numArg3);
bool AbilityUnlock(Character character, string argStr, int argInt, AbilityData data);
void AbilityPrice(Character character, AbilityData abilityData, int abilityLevel, int maxLevel, out int price, out int time);
```

If you use the `ScriptableFunction` attribute on any functions
that match any of these signatures inside a `GeneralScript`,
they will be picked up and can then be called from anywhere.

## Execution

To call any scriptable function, simply get their reference
and then call them like any other delegate.

```cs
var func = ScriptableFunctions.Character.Get("SCR_Get_Character_MAXPATK");
var maxPatk = func(character);

// ...
```

## Usage

Internally we primarily use scriptable functions for item interactions
and combat calculations, where this feature makes it easier for us to
interact with the client and take advantage of existing information.

For example, most any combat skill uses the function `SCR_SkillHit`
to calculate the skill damage and determine the hit outcome, such as
whether a crit or dodge should occur. These functions being scriptable
also means that they can easily be overwritten from custom scripts,
which may allow users to modify their behavior. If you dislike certain
formulas for example, changing them might be a rather simple matter.
The following example will change crit chance to always be 50%,
no matter what.

```cs
[ScriptableFunction]
public float SCR_GetCritChance(ICombatEntity attacker, ICombatEntity target, Skill skill, SkillModifier modifier, SkillHitResult skillHitResult)
{
	return 50;
}
```

## Overrides

In cases where scripts replace and override existing functions, the original
can be retrieved via the global `ScriptableFunctions` class. The respective
method, `TryGetOverridden`, is available on all function type lists
and takes a reference to the *current* function, which it uses to
look up the function that was overridden by it.

The example below shows how the core function `SCR_Get_Character_MHP`
gets overridden and its result halved, effectively modifying characters'
max HP by -50%. Note how the function reference passed to `TryGetOverridden`
is the function that is being executed. The overridden function returned
will then be the one that was referenced by the name `SCR_Get_Character_MHP`
before the script parser encountered the newer version.

```cs
[ScriptableFunction]
public static float SCR_Get_Character_MHP(Character character)
{
	if (!ScriptableFunctions.Character.TryGetOverridden(SCR_Get_Character_MHP, out var overriddenFunc))
		throw new MissingMemberException("Overridden function SCR_Get_Character_MHP not found.");

	var originalResult = overriddenFunc(character);

	// Reduce max HP by 50%
	return (int)Math.Max(1, originalResult * 0.5f);
}
```

The function returned is always the immediate one that was overridden by
the newer version and the system keeps track of all overrides. This means
if a function is overridden multiple times, each one is able to reference
its immediate parent. This way it's possible to walk up the tree of
overrides by repeatedly passing the reference to the overridden function
to `TryGetOverridden`, should there ever be a need to find even older
versions.

Accessing overridden functions is useful primarily when modifying results,
such as the calculations of existing core functions. The original function
will be executed in its entirety and any changes it might make globally
or to its given arguments persist, regardless of what the overriding
function does.

An example of a function type that would rarely be overridden is an item
script function, as its behavior is self-contained and it returns only
the result of the item usage. Although there are cases where overriding
such a function could be used to monitor or react to certain results.

## More

To find more examples and figure out which functions may exist for
potential overrides, we recommend studying the scripts found in Melia.
Particularly, the files in `system/scripts/zone/core/`.
