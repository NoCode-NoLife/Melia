FAQ
=============================================================================

How can I register for and play on the Melia server?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Melia is not a server to play on, but a software designed to operate
as a server that you can set up on your own machine and then log into.
There are no official servers operated by the Melia team.


Can I run a server for my friends using Melia?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, you can set up your own server using Melia and play on it,
either alone or with other players. But please keep in mind that
Melia is still early in development and might not yet offer the
experience you're looking for.

For instructions, check the getting started guide in the doc folder.


Is feature X implemented yet?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to the amount of content and features that are to be implemented,
it's difficult to keep an accurate list of things that are or are
not working. The easiest way to find out if a given feature works
is to set up a Melia server and check. Alternatively, you may ask
in our Discord chat.


Where can I download the client?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The server is network compatible with the latest international ToS
client available on Steam. Check the getting started guide in the doc
folder for more information on how to connect to a Melia server.

Please keep both the server and your designated Melia client up-to-date,
but be patient just after client patches, as it may take a few hours for
us to update compatibility.


Does Melia run on Linux?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is supposed to, but truth be told, most testing takes place on Windows.
We appreciate any feedback or reports you can give us on issues or the
current state of things on Linux and MacOS. We are very much aiming to
support all major operating systems and we'll be working with our users
to ensure compatibility.


How can I contribute?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We very much appreciate any offers for help, though the project is
somewhat difficult to get into at this stage in its development phase.
We're still in the process of ironing out many of the underlying systems
as well as the overarching goals of the project.

If you have prior experience developing server emulators, we invite
you to jump straight into the code, mess around with it, and join us
on Discord and GitHub to discuss what others are working on and what
you might contribute directly.

If you're a developer without extensive experience in this particular
field, we recommend studying the project and starting with simpler
customizations and extensions that you may share with other users
or submit for a pull request to see if it may be a good fit for
the core project. Scripts in particular may be a good starting
point.

And if you're primarily a motivated member of the community, consider
being active on Discord, engage in discussions about the project's
future, and offer a helping hand if the developers have issues
gathering data or information. It's honest work that helps the
project stay alive.


Is there a TODO list?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Keeping a formal and official list of either finished or unfinished
features and mechanics would require considerable efforts on the side
of the developers, due to the sheer amount of them. As such, we sadly
have to rely on users to more or less figure sh*t out.

That being said, we're keeping a rough, generalized list of functional
features in the README and a list of implemented skills in an issue on
GitHub. Other issues may provide further data on yet to be implemented
functions, and finally, you can always ask on our Discord server.


Why are you (not) using library/framework/pattern X?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All design decisions made in Melia were carefully deliberated and chosen
on purpose for one reason or another. Not everybody will agree with all
of them, but rest assured that they were not made lightly.

If you have suggestions on how to improve the project and its code, we'd
be happy to hear from you, but know in advance that we have strong feelings
about Melia's design.


We winning, friends?

Uh... Let me check ChatGPT real quick.

There you go =)
