Melia
=============================================================================

Melia is an open-source MMORPG server, developed as a collaborative affort
of programmers from all around the world. We're aiming to create a server
software that provides a stable and extensible platform for users to build
their own projects on top of, while giving developers the oppurtunity to
learn and hone their skills in a familar environment.

This project is very explicilty not about playing a game or competing
with any services provided by game developers or publishers, and we don't
endorse such actions. We're here to learn and create, not to steal or
destroy.

Client
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Melia does not have a client of its own at this time. Instead, it's designed
to be network compatible with the latest client of the international
version of ToS, which is freely available on Steam.

State of Development
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Melia has been in semi-active development for several years, and is
being worked on more or less depending on the time and motivation of
the available developers. The server is functional and provides many
of the typical features you would expect from an online RPG, but
there's still a way to go before we'd call it truly playable.

Specifically, some of the major features that are working are as follows:
- Characters (creation, deletion, etc.)
- Inventory (managing items, equipping, etc.)
- Chat
- Stats
- Skills
  - Distrbution of skill points
  - Basic and experimental combat, incl. monster AI
  - Basic and experimental support for select skills
- NPC dialogues and shops
- Monster spawns
- Quests

Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Melia is being developed in C# (.NET 8+) and uses a MySQL database for
its storage. As such, to use Melia you will need the following:

- The .NET SDK (8+)
- A MySQL-compatible database server (MariaDB 10+ recommended)

On an up-to-date Windows system, the SDK will already be included,
so you only need to install a MySQL-compatible server. On Linux and
macOS, you will need to install the SDK as well.

For more detailed instructions, please wait patiently while we give
our documentation a much-needed overhaul. It's only a matter of time.

Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Compile Melia
* Run `sql/main.sql` to setup the database
* Copy `system/conf/database.conf` to `user/conf/`,
  adjust the necessary values and remove the rest.

Afterwards, you should be able to start Melia via the provided scripts or
directly from the bin directories. If not, or if you need a more detailed
guide, head over to our forum, the chat, or the wiki.
