Melia
==============================

Melia is an open-source MMORPG server software for the international client
of Tree of Savior. It's solely being developed for educational purposes,
learning about programming, MMORPGs, maintaining huge projects, working with
other people, and improving knowledge. It's not about playing a game or
competing with any services provided by IMCGAMES or its partners, and we
don't endorse such actions.

Melia is completely free and licensed under the GNU GPL.
As such, every user is free to use Melia and choose how to use it,
in the context of its license.

Compatibility

Melia is only compatible to the latest iTOS client,
compatibility to any other clients or versions is
not guaranteed, and in fact unlikely.
